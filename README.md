# Quadratic Equations Solver

## Description

This unique script provides 5th grades with ultimate power of solving square equations! Due to rather big developers team
it is provided with module tests and pre-commit check. When a time of committing comes, it runs all module tests and if
some of them failed, it aborts the commit and prints a message about module test that failed.

## Usage

Just use `from quadratic_equation import get_roots` to use it in your project! If something is wrong you will know it during
the commit.

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
