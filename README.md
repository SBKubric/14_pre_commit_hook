# Quadratic Equations Solver

## Description

This unique script provides 5th grades with ultimate power of solving square equations! Due to rather big developers team
it is provided with module tests and pre-commit check. When a time of committing comes, it runs all module tests and if
some of them failed, it aborts the commit and prints a message about module test that failed.

If you want to know more about git-hook technique you could use this [link](http://githooks.com/).

## Usage

Just run the script file `./init_hooks` to use pre-commit hook in your project!

If you want to add extra hooks, just place them into
`./hooks/` directory and run the `./init_hooks`.

Also you can define extra scripts in the `makefile` and `./hooks/*`.
